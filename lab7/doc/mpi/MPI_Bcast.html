<title>MPI Library Reference: MPI_Bcast</title>

<h2>MPI_Bcast</h2>

This function broadcasts a message from the "root" process to all other
processes in the group.<p>

<h3>Prototype:</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>MPI_Bcast(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype,</b>
<dd><b>int root, MPI_Comm comm);</b>
</dl>

This routine acts as either a send or a receive, depending on whether or
not the current node is the 'root'.  It should be run by all processes
simultaneously, and will allow the root process (specified by the parameter
'root') to send a message to all other processes.  The non-root processes 
all receive the message into their own buffer (given by 'buf').<p>

Specifically:

<dl><dt><b>void *buf</b>:
<dd>For the "root" process, this pointer should point to the data
to be sent to the other processes.  For the other processes, this should
point to the buffer in which to receive the data.

<dt><b>int count</b>:
<dd>This integer should tell how many elements of data you are sending or
expect to receive.  

<dt><b>MPI_Datatype datatype</b>:
<dd>Here is where you tell MPI what type of data you are sending or 
receiving.  There are specially defined constants for all the standard 
C types, like MPI_INT and MPI_DOUBLE.  

<dt><b>int root</b>:
<dd>This integer should specify the index of the "root" process.  MPI
will use this number to figure out which process is doing the sending
and which are receiving.

<dt><b>MPI_Comm comm</b>:
<dd>Next we have the <i>Comm</i> variable that we've seen in 
<a href="MPI_Comm_rank.html">MPI_Comm_rank</a> and 
<a href="MPI_Comm_size.html">MPI_Comm_size</a>; for now you can just 
ignore it and pass in "MPI_COMM_WORLD", but it is in fact useful if 
you intend to limit broadcasts to only certain groups of nodes.<p>

</dl>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<dl>
<dt>To broadcast an array of five integers from the array called "rc_arr" on 
    process zero into the array of the same name on all other processes:
<dd><pre>
MPI_Bcast(rc_arr, 5, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
</pre>
<dt>To broadcast a single double from "x" on process seven into "x" on all 
    other processes:
<dd><pre>
MPI_Bcast(&x, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, 7, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
</pre>
</dl>
