<h2>MPI_Recv</h2>

This function allows one process to wait and collect data from 
another process.<p>


<h3>Prototype:</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>MPI_Recv(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int source</b>
<dd><b>int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status);</b>
</dl>

This function will allow any process to wait for data from another 
process; let "buf" point to space for the data you want to receive, and 
let "source" be the number of the process you want to send it to you.<p>

Specifically:

<dl><dt><b>void *buf</b>:
<dd>This void pointer should point to the beginning of some space where 
you'd like the received data to be stored.  For example, if you expected 
to receive an array of integers, and had declared space for an array 
called "rc_arr", you'd probably want to pass "<b>rc_arr</b>" in here.<p>

<dt><b>int count</b>:
<dd>This integer should tell how many elements of data you expect to receive.  
For example, if you hope to get an array of five integers, this argument 
should be 5.<p>

<dt><b>MPI_Datatype datatype</b>:
<dd>Here is where you tell MPI what type of data you are receiving.  There are 
specially defined constants for all the standard C types.  For example, if you 
were waiting for an array of ints, you would pass "MPI_INT".  If you were 
receiving doubles, you'd pass "MPI_DOUBLE", and so on.  You get the idea.<p>

<dt><b>int source</b>:
<dd>This integer should tell from which process you expect the data to come.  
For example, if you are waiting for data from the process with rank 1, you'd 
send in a 1.  Sending in the integer MPI_ANY_SOURCE will accept a message from
any node.<p>

<dt><b>int tag</b>:
<dd>This parameter allows you to specify that you are waiting only for 
messages with a specific tag.  (See the desciption on 
<a href="MPI_Send.html#tag">tag</a> for the 
<a href="MPI_Send.html">MPI_Send</a> command).  This is not really a very 
useful feature for this function, where we are just transferring data from 
one process to another.  For now, just tag all your messages with 0, or use
the integer MPI_ANY_TAG, which will accept any tag.<p>

<dt><b>MPI_Comm comm</b>:
<dd>Next, there's the same random <i>Comm</i> variable that we've seen in 
<a href="MPI_Comm_rank.html">MPI_Comm_rank</a> and 
<a href="MPI_Comm_size.html">MPI_Comm_size</a>; just ignore it and pass in 
"MPI_COMM_WORLD".<p>

<dt><b>MPI_Status *status</b>:
<dd>Finally, there's a random status flag that also comes back from the 
receive operation.  That is, MPI_Recv will put a value into a variable of 
type "MPI_Status" that it expects you to have declared.  So if your program is 
going to use MPI_Recv, you must declare a varaible of type "MPI_Status" and pass 
its address into MPI_Recv every time you call it. <p>
If you are interested, the MPI_Status thing is actually a structure which MPI_Recv
will fill with some useful information.  Specifically, if "stat" is a 
variable of type MPI_Status, and you've passed "&amp;stat" into MPI_Recv, then 
"stat.MPI_SOURCE" and "stat.MPI_TAG" will tell you the source node and tag, 
respectively, of the message you just received. <p>
</dl>

<p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

(In these examples, "status" is a variable of type "MPI_Status".)<p>

<dl>
<dt>To get an array of five integers into the array called "rc_arr" from 
    process one:
<dd><pre>
MPI_Recv(rc_arr, 5, MPI_INT, 1, 0,
         MPI_COMM_WORLD, &status);
</pre>
<dt>To receive a single double into "x" from process seven:
<dd><pre>
MPI_Recv(&x, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, 7, 0,
         MPI_COMM_WORLD, &status);
</pre>
</dl>

<p>

Finally, note that this MPI_Recv command will wait until the data that has been 
requested actually comes in.  That is, if process 3 decided to run the first 
example MPI_Recv command above, it would stop there and hold until process 1, 
running on another machine, decided to run a corresponding 
<a href="MPI_Send.html">MPI_Send</a> command to send data to process 3.<p>

At that point, the data would be transfered, and both processes 1 and 3 would 
continue.  However, this feature demands that you be careful from where you 
request data; if a process were to wait for data from a process that was never 
going to send it any, it would be stuck.<p>
