<title>MPI Library Reference: MPI_Finalize</title>

<h2>MPI_Finalize</h2>

This function finalizes, cleans up, and generally shuts down the MPI 
environment.  It should be the last command executed by your program -- just 
before the close-brace in main(), or just before calling "<i>exit</i>" to exit 
the program.<p>

<h3>Prototype:</h3>

<b>MPI_Finalize(void);</b><p>

You should call MPI_Finalize right before your program stops, to let MPI 
know that this process is finished.  Remember, a single MPI program will 
actually run as multiple processes running on different machines, and the 
different processes might likely finish at different times. When one of 
these processes calls MPI_Finalize, MPI knows that process is done.  The 
other processes, still running, will continue unaffected.<p>

MPI_Finalize will generally be called always and only this way:<p>

<dl><dl>
<pre>

     /* At the very end of function main() above... */

   MPI_Finalize();
}
                                  /* End of Program */
</pre>
</dl></dl>

MPI_Finalize finalizes your program in the same way that 
<a href="MPI_Init.html">MPI_Init</a> initializes it.
There's not much else to say.<p>
