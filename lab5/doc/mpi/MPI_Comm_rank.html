<title>MPI Library Reference: MPI_Comm_rank</title>

<h2>MPI_Comm_rank</h2>

This function determines the process number of the calling process, and 
returns it in its second argument.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Prototype:</h3>

<b>MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_Comm comm, int *rank);</b><p>

When an MPI program is run with N machines, an identical copy of the program 
is started simultaneously on all of the N machines, numbered 0 through N-1.  
This function lets any one of the processes find out which one it is.  (For 
the process running on machine 0, rank will return as 0; For the process 
running on machine 1, rank will return as 1, and so on.)<p>

The first argument, the MPI_Comm thing, is more confusing.  For now, just 
ignore it, and send in an "MPI_COMM_WORLD".<p>

<hr>

MPI_Comm_rank should be called fairly early in the program because the 
information it returns (which machine the process is running on) is very 
useful.  A parallel program accomplishes its task by splitting a job among 
many machines.  Therefore, it makes sense that your process would need to know 
fairly soon what machine it is so it can figure out what part of the problem 
to work on.<p>

Usually, in fact, the first three lines of your program will be as follows:<p>

<pre>
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
   int rank,total;

   <a href="MPI_Init.html">MPI_Init</a>(&argc,&argv);
   <a href="MPI_Comm_rank.html">MPI_Comm_rank</a>(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
   <a href="MPI_Comm_size.html">MPI_Comm_size</a>(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &total);

     /* Now main knows how many machines there are (total),
           and which of those this instance of it 
           is running on (rank).                         */
     /* Continue with rest of main() below... */

</pre>
