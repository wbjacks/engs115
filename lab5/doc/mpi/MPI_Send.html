<h2>MPI_Send</h2>

This function allows one process to send some data to another process.<p>

<h3>Prototype:</h3>

<b>MPI_Send(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int dest, int tag, MPI_Comm comm);</b>

<p>
This function will allow any process to send data to another process; let 
"buf" point to the data you want to send, and let "dest" be the number of 
the process you want to send it to.<p>

Specifically:
<dl>

<dt><b>void *buf</b>:
<dd>This void pointer should point to the beginning of the data you want 
sent.  For example, if you wanted to send an array of integers called "my_arr" 
(where my_arr is an int *), you'd probably want to pass "<b>my_arr</b>" in 
here.<p>

<dt><b>int count</b>:
<dd>This integer should tell how many elements of data you are sending.  For 
example, if you wanted to send an array of five integers, this argument should 
be 5.<p>

<dt><b>MPI_Datatype datatype</b>:
<dd>Here is where you tell MPI what type of data you are sending.  There are 
specially defined constants for all the standard C types.  For example, if you 
were sending an array of ints, you would pass "MPI_INT".  If you were sending 
doubles, you'd pass "MPI_DOUBLE", and so on.  You get the idea.<p>

<dt><b>int dest</b>:
<dd>This integer should tell to which process you wish this data sent.  For 
example, if you are communicating to process 3, you'd send in a 3.<p>

<a name="tag">
<dt><b>int tag</b>: 
<dd>This parameter allows you to stick a tag onto your message.  For 
example, if you were sending, intermittently, messages of two different 
types, you might want to give the two different types of messages 
different tags.  The corresponding receive commands also have a tag field, 
so that some processes, for example, could only be paying attention to 
mesages of one tag or another. However, this is not really very useful for 
this function where we are just sending one block of data from one process 
to another.  For now, just tag your messages with 0.<p>

<dt><b>MPI_Comm comm</b>:
<dd>Finally, there's the same random <i>Comm</i> variable that we've seen in 
<a href="MPI_Comm_rank.html">MPI_Comm_rank</a> and 
<a href="MPI_Comm_size.html">MPI_Comm_size</a>; just ignore it and pass in 
"MPI_COMM_WORLD".<p>

</dl>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<dl>
<dt>To send an array of five integers called "my_arr" to process three:
<dd><pre>
MPI_Send(my_arr, 5, MPI_INT, 3,
         0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
</pre>
<dt>To send a single double in "x" to process eight:
<dd><pre>
MPI_Send(&x, 1, MPI_DOUBLE, 8,
         0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
</pre>
</dl>
