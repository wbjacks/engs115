<h3>Prototype:</h3>

<b>double MPI_Wtime();</b><p>

This routine is useful in <a href="../timing.html">timing</a>
code.  Note that the clocks of different processes are not
synchronized and that the usefulness of this routine is in
determining <em>elapsed time</em>, not when you should get
up in the morning.<p>

<hr>
<p>
This routine is generally used in the following manner:<p>

<pre>

    double start,
           end,
           time_elapsed;

    ...

    start = MPI_Wtime();

    /* Something you want to time. */

    end = MPI_Wtime();
    time_elapsed = end - start;

</pre>
