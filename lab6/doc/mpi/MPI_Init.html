<title>MPI Library Reference: MPI_Init</title>

<h2>MPI_Init</h2>

This function initializes, sets up, and generally prepares MPI for your 
program.  You should run MPI_Init in main() before doing anything else -- it 
should be the first command your program executes.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Prototype:</h3>

<b>MPI_Init(int *argc,char ***argv);</b><p>

You should call MPI_Init as the first command in "main()", and pass it the 
addresses of <tt>argv</tt> and <tt>argc</tt>.  MPI_Init will fix argv and argc 
so that you can check command-line arguments as normal.<p>

MPI_Init should generally be called always and only this way:<p>

<dl><dl>
<pre>
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
   int x,y,z;  /* ..Etc.. declare variables here like normal */
   
   MPI_Init(&argc,&argv);

     /* Continue with rest of main() below... */

</pre>
</dl></dl>

MPI_Init initializes your program in the same way that 
<a href="MPI_Finalize.html">MPI_Finalize</a> finalizes it.
There's not much else to say.<p>
