<h2>MPI_Barrier</h2>

This function (loosely) synchronizes all of the processes under the
given communicator.  All processes are guaranteed to have
reached the call before any of them continue.  (They aren't
guaranteed to leave the call at the same time, but in
practice they should.)<p>

<h3>Prototype:</h3>

<b>MPI_Barrier(MPI_Comm comm);</b><p>

This routine is useful in <a href="../timing.html">timing</a>
code or in other situations where synchronization is necessary.
For most purposes, the communicator argument should just be
"MPI_COMM_WORLD" (i.e., all processes participate in must
reach the barrier for the computation to continue).<p>

<p>
The use of this routine is pretty straight-forward:<p>

<pre>

    /* If there is still a process here... */
    MPI_Barrier(MPI_COMM_WORLD)
    /* ...then there aren't any processes here. */

</pre>
